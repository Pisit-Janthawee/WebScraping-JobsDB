There is no “annual indexation” of salaries, you may be upgraded several times within the year, or none, based on your own pace of progress, ambitions, relevant skillset and recognition by clients.Work-Life IntegrationWe challenge the notion of work-life balance, we embrace the notion of work-life integration instead. This philosophy looks into our lives as a single whole where we serve ourselves, our families and our clients in an integrated manner. We encourage 100% flexible working hours where you arrange your day. This means you are free when you have little work, but this also means extra effort if you are behind schedule. Working on a Western project also means nobody bothers you during the whole day but you may have to jump on a scrum call in the evening to talk to your team overseas. We appreciate time and we minimize time spent on Adastra meetings. We are also a remote-first company. While we have our collaboration offices and social events, we encourage people to work 100% remote from home whenever possible. This means saving time and money on commute, staying home with elderly and little ones, not missing the special moments in life. This also means you can work from any of our other offices in Europe, North America or Australia, or move to a place with lower cost of living without impacting your income. We trust you by default until you fail our trust.Global DiversityAdastra Thailand is an international organization. We hire globally and our biggest partners and clients are in Europe, North America and Australia. We work on teams with individuals from different culture, ethnicity, sexual preference, political views or religion. We have zero tolerance to anyone who doesn’t pay respect to others or is abusive in any way. We speak different languages to one another, but we speak English when we are together or with clients. Our company is a safe space where communication is encouraged but boundaries regarding sensitive topics are respected. We accept and converge together to serve our teams and clients and ultimately have good time at work.Lifelong LearningOn annual average we invest 25% of our working hours to personal development and upskilling outside project work, regardless of seniority or role. We feature more than 400 courses on our Training Repo and we continue to actively purchase or tailor hands-on content. We certify people on our expense. We like to say we are technology agnostic; we learn the principles of data management and we apply it on different use cases and different technology stacks. We believe that the juniors today are the seniors tomorrow, we treat everyone with respect and mentor them into the roles they deserve. We encourage seniors to give back to the IT community through leadership and mentorship. On your last day with us we may give you an open dated job offer so that you feel welcome to return home as others did before you.\xa0More About Adastra:Visit http://adastragrp.com\xa0': 'Technical Requirements Gathering and Development of Functional SpecificationsWork with the Agile multi-cultural team in Thailand, EU and Canada in the design, development, deployment, and support of our data management solutionsTraining & Working on AWS/Azure Clouds utilizing Python on SparkTroubleshoot application and code issuesSupport to Junior Developers, Team Leadership/Mentorship', 'Job Description': '(Required) Bachelor University Degree in IT Related Major(Required) At least 2 year of experience in a Python-based application development(Required) Fluency in English and Thai (Spoken/Written)(Required) Work Diligence and Responsibility(Required) Communication, Presentation and Networking Skills(Required) Familiarity with SQL/NoSQL databases(Optional) Exposure to AWS Cloud is an advantage – Glue, S3, Redshift, Terraform(Optional) Exposure to Azure Cloud is an advantage – Databricks, Synapse, Data Factory(Optional) Experience in a Web application, Web API(Optional) Experience with Data Warehousing – Data Lake, Relational and Dimensional Models(Optional) Experience with Spark-based technology such as PySpark or Scala is a plus(Optional) Experience in the Automobile industry would be an advantage', 'Profile Requirements': 'Starting Monthly Salary = 60,000 – 120,000 THB (based on experience and expertise)Ongoing (Quarterly) Compensation Package ReviewsOngoing (Monthly) Performance Bonus Payouts100% Petty Cash Reimbursements100% Visa & Work Permit Expenses100% Flexible Working Hours on Project Demand100% Remote Work (Home Office) AllowanceCollaboration Offices in Bangkok & Chiang Mai30-40 Days Paid Absence (Vacations, Holidays)Birthday BonusAnnual Health CheckPrivate Health Insurance\xa0Provident Fund Enrollment400+ Lifelong Learning CoursesQuick Leadership Paths for SeniorsForeign Company Open Door PolicyWork & Travel Opportunities in EU and CanadaNationwide & Global Contracting (Negotiable Terms)'}",Middle,"Information Technology (IT), Programming / Software Development, IT Consulting, Data Scientist","Full Time, Permanent",https://bg.adastragrp.com/contacts/,"Adastra Thailand is a company within Adastra Group.

Managers are elected to make sure that employees have all the processes, resources, and information they need to provide services to clients in an efficient manner. Any manager up to the CEO is visible and reachable for a chat regardless their title. Decisions are taken with a consent in an agile manner and executed efficiently in no overdue time. We accept that wrong decisions happen and we appreciate the learning before we adjust the process for a continuous improvement. Employees serve clients. Employees listen attentively to client needs and collaborate internally as a team to cater to them. Managers and employees work together to get things done and are accountable to each other. Corporate KPIs are transparently reviewed on monthly company events with all employees.Performance Driven CompensationWe recognize and accept that some of us are more ambitious, more gifted, or more hard-working. We also recognize that some of us look for a stable income and lesser hassle at a different stage of their careers. There is a place for everyone, we embrace and need this diversity. Grades in our company are not based on number of years of experience, they are value driven based on everyone’s ability to deliver independently their work to clients and/or lead others. There is no “anniversary/annual” bonus, we distribute bonuses on a monthly recurring basis as an instant gratification for performance and this bonus is practically unlimited. There is no “annual indexation” of salaries, you may be upgraded several times within the year, or none, based on your own pace of progress, ambitions, relevant skillset and recognition by clients.Work-Life IntegrationWe challenge the notion of work-life balance, we embrace the notion of work-life integration instead. This philosophy looks into our lives as a single whole where we serve ourselves, our families and our clients in an integrated manner. We encourage 100% flexible working hours where you arrange your day. This means you are free when you have little work, but this also means extra effort if you are behind schedule. Working on a Western project also means nobody bothers you during the whole day but you may have to jump on a scrum call in the evening to talk to your team overseas. We appreciate time and we minimize time spent on Adastra meetings. We are also a remote-first company. While we have our collaboration offices and social events, we encourage people to work 100% remote from home whenever possible. This means saving time and money on commute, staying home with elderly and little ones, not missing the special moments in life. This also means you can work from any of our other offices in Europe, North America or Australia, or move to a place with lower cost of living without impacting your income. We trust you by default until you fail our trust.Global DiversityAdastra Thailand is an international organization. We hire globally and our biggest partners and clients are in Europe, North America and Australia. We work on teams with individuals from different culture, ethnicity, sexual preference, political views or religion. We have zero tolerance to anyone who doesn’t pay respect to others or is abusive in any way. We speak different languages to one another, but we speak English when we are together or with clients. Our company is a safe space where communication is encouraged but boundaries regarding sensitive topics are respected. We accept and converge together to serve our teams and clients and ultimately have good time at work.Lifelong LearningOn annual average we invest 25% of our working hours to personal development and upskilling outside project work, regardless of seniority or role. We feature more than 400 courses on our Training Repo and we continue to actively purchase or tailor hands-on content. We certify people on our expense. We like to say we are technology agnostic; we learn the principles of data management and we apply it on different use cases and different technology stacks. We believe that the juniors today are the seniors tomorrow, we treat everyone with respect and mentor them into the roles they deserve. We encourage seniors to give back to the IT community through leadership and mentorship. On your last day with us we may give you an open dated job offer so that you feel welcome to return home as others did before you.\xa0More About Adastra:Visit http://adastragrp.com\xa0"": 'Technical Requirements Gathering and Development of Functional SpecificationsGenerating and delivering quality reports to customers and performing quality assurance checksTranslating business needs into technical specifications.Developing reporting systems that provide accessible information for decision-making.Using warehouse data to generate reports to support business decision-making and business performance monitoring.Maintaining data analytics platforms.Evaluating and improving existing BI-related systems.Conducting troubleshooting on data models.', 'Technical Requirements Gathering and Development of Functional Specifications': ""A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related fieldAt least 1 years of experience as a BI Developer and/or data warehouse design.Fluency in English\xa0Technical expertise in Power BI, Analysis Services, Tabular Models and \xa0DAX.Strong problem-solving and analytical skills, attention to detail and teamwork.Good communication skills.Career path ambition – Motivation for a management position in a foreign company.Work diligence & initiative – “Deliver no Matter What” attitude.Skilled in Azure SQL Database, SQL Server and SAP HANA is a plus."", 'Generating and delivering quality reports to customers and performing quality assurance checks': 'Starting Monthly Salary = 50,000 – 100,000 THB (Negotiable)Ongoing (Quarterly) Compensation Package ReviewsOngoing (Monthly) Performance Bonus Payouts100% Petty Cash Reimbursements100% Visa & Work Permit Expenses100% Flexible Working Hours on Project Demand100% Remote Work (Home Office) AllowanceCollaboration Offices in Bangkok & Chiang Mai30-40 Days Paid Absence (Vacations, Holidays)Birthday BonusPrivate Health InsuranceProvident Fund Enrollment400+ Lifelong Learning CoursesQuick Leadership Paths for SeniorsForeign Company Open Door PolicyWork & Travel Opportunities in EU and CanadaNationwide & Global Contracting (Negotiable Terms)'}",Middle,"Information Technology (IT), IT Consulting, Data Scientist","Full Time, Permanent",https://bg.adastragrp.com/contacts/,"Adastra Thailand is a company within Adastra Group.

Export-Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM Bank) is a financial institution wholly owned by the Royal Thai Government under the Ministry of Finance’s supervision. EXIM Bank was established by the Export-Import
 Bank of Thailand Act B.E. 2536 (1993) which became effective on September 7, 1993. According to the Act, the initial capital of 2,500 million baht was paid by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand. Following rapid business expansion, the Bank’s
 capital was increased with the Ministry of Finance’s additional contribution of 2,500 million baht and 1,500 million baht in April and July 1998, respectively. Under the Export-Import Bank of Thailand Act, EXIM Bank is empowered to engage in various business
 undertakings. EXIM Bank can offer short-term as well as long-term credits, either in domestic or overseas markets, in baht or any foreign currency denominations. In mobilizing funds, EXIM Bank can borrow from local or overseas financial institutions, as well
 as issue short-term or long-term financial instruments for sale to financial institutions and the general public, both domestically and internationally. Essentially, EXIM Bank can engage in any financial activities customary to commercial bank practices, except
 for accepting deposit from the general public. EXIM Bank officially started its operation on February 17, 1994. In November 1999, the Export-Import Bank of Thailand Act (No. 2) B.E. 2542 (1999) was enforced to clarify and expand the Bank's objective and scope
 of operation with regard to investment promotion and support. The amendment enabled the Bank to Provide more comprehensive support to Thai investors overseas as well as local investors in business relating to export or business which earns or saves foreign
 exchange. ",Others,,https://th.jobsdb.com//th/en/job/data-warehouse-manager-300003002963173?token=0~c63a900a-9b4e-4242-b188-1050954e54be&sectionRank=159&jobId=jobsdb-th-job-300003002963173

Managers are elected to make sure that employees have all the processes, resources, and information they need to provide services to clients in an efficient manner. Any manager up to the CEO is visible and reachable for a chat regardless their title. Decisions are taken with a consent in an agile manner and executed efficiently in no overdue time. We accept that wrong decisions happen and we appreciate the learning before we adjust the process for a continuous improvement. Employees serve clients. Employees listen attentively to client needs and collaborate internally as a team to cater to them. Managers and employees work together to get things done and are accountable to each other. Corporate KPIs are transparently reviewed on monthly company events with all employees.Performance Driven CompensationWe recognize and accept that some of us are more ambitious, more gifted, or more hard-working. We also recognize that some of us look for a stable income and lesser hassle at a different stage of their careers. There is a place for everyone, we embrace and need this diversity. Grades in our company are not based on number of years of experience, they are value driven based on everyone’s ability to deliver independently their work to clients and/or lead others. There is no “anniversary/annual” bonus, we distribute bonuses on a monthly recurring basis as an instant gratification for performance and this bonus is practically unlimited. There is no “annual indexation” of salaries, you may be upgraded several times within the year, or none, based on your own pace of progress, ambitions, relevant skillset and recognition by clients.Work-Life IntegrationWe challenge the notion of work-life balance, we embrace the notion of work-life integration instead. This philosophy looks into our lives as a single whole where we serve ourselves, our families and our clients in an integrated manner. We encourage 100% flexible working hours where you arrange your day. This means you are free when you have little work, but this also means extra effort if you are behind schedule. Working on a Western project also means nobody bothers you during the whole day but you may have to jump on a scrum call in the evening to talk to your team overseas. We appreciate time and we minimize time spent on Adastra meetings. We are also a remote-first company. While we have our collaboration offices and social events, we encourage people to work 100% remote from home whenever possible. This means saving time and money on commute, staying home with elderly and little ones, not missing the special moments in life. This also means you can work from any of our other offices in Europe, North America or Australia, or move to a place with lower cost of living without impacting your income. We trust you by default until you fail our trust.Global DiversityAdastra Thailand is an international organization. We hire globally and our biggest partners and clients are in Europe, North America and Australia. We work on teams with individuals from different culture, ethnicity, sexual preference, political views or religion. We have zero tolerance to anyone who doesn’t pay respect to others or is abusive in any way. We speak different languages to one another, but we speak English when we are together or with clients. Our company is a safe space where communication is encouraged but boundaries regarding sensitive topics are respected. We accept and converge together to serve our teams and clients and ultimately have good time at work.Lifelong LearningOn annual average we invest 25% of our working hours to personal development and upskilling outside project work, regardless of seniority or role. We feature more than 400 courses on our Training Repo and we continue to actively purchase or tailor hands-on content. We certify people on our expense. We like to say we are technology agnostic; we learn the principles of data management and we apply it on different use cases and different technology stacks. We believe that the juniors today are the seniors tomorrow, we treat everyone with respect and mentor them into the roles they deserve. We encourage seniors to give back to the IT community through leadership and mentorship. On your last day with us we may give you an open dated job offer so that you feel welcome to return home as others did before you.\xa0More About Adastra:Visit http://adastragrp.com\xa0 to apply for a job : please send your CV to HRTH(@)adastragrp.com"": 'Provide technical support and monitoring on Data Warehouse solutions – Oracle, MSSQLWork with ITSM system for Incident ManagementPerform database performance monitoring and tuningPlan the support of growing data storage and workloadsMaintain database reliability and high availability best practicesPerform audit and compliances activitiesCollectively maintain technical documentationCollaborate on technical issues with stakeholders from Development and Customer teams', 'Job Description': ""A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related fieldAt least 1 year of experience as a Database AdministratorTechnical expertise in Oracle or SQL ServerFluency in EnglishGood knowledge of Linux, Cloud (Azure preferable) and ETL processStrong problem-solving and analytical skills, attention to detail and teamworkGood communication skills and being a team playerWork diligence & initiative – “Deliver no Matter What” attitude"", 'As a Database Administrator,you will be responsible for:': 'Starting Monthly Salary = 80,000 – 120,000 THB (Based on Seniority)Ongoing (Quarterly) Compensation Package ReviewsOngoing (Monthly) Performance Bonus Payouts100% Petty Cash Reimbursements100% Visa & Work Permit Expenses100% Flexible Working Hours on Project Demand100% Remote Work (Home Office) AllowanceCollaboration Offices in Bangkok & Chiang Mai30-40 Days Paid Absence (Vacations, Holidays)Birthday BonusPrivate Health InsuranceProvident Fund Enrollment400+ Lifelong Learning CoursesQuick Leadership Paths for SeniorsForeign Company Open Door PolicyWork & Travel Opportunities in EU and CanadaNationwide & Global Contracting (Negotiable Terms)'}",Middle,"Information Technology (IT), DBA","Full Time, Permanent",https://bg.adastragrp.com/contacts/,"Adastra Thailand is a company within Adastra Group.

In response to the increase in public concern on the independence of auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers Thailand (operating under PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Management Services Limited) has reached a decision to discontinue those business units that provide
 services relating to software design/implementation, IT and business process outsourcing. In that connection, Khun Soontorn Dentham, the Managing Director / lead partner of PriceWaterHouseCoopers Risk Management Services Limited at that time, has decided to
 set up a separate legal entity, Humanica Public Company Limited, to carry on those businesses.  As the result, the service team, including necessary operating assets and intellectual properties, were transferred to Humanica Public Company Limited.",Human Resources Management/Consultancy,"Free shuttle bus, Life insurance, Medical insurance, Performance bonus, Five-day work week",https://th.jobsdb.com//th/en/job/erp-consultant-erp-support-all-level-300003002968118?token=0~af8c41a6-a86a-41ba-a0db-e2b7001e0c6f&sectionRank=276&jobId=jobsdb-th-job-300003002968118

Company Culture

พวกเราคือเหล่าโจรสลัดที่พร้อมจะออกล่างาน Web and Mobile Development
เราทำงานกับแบบพี่น้อง ไม่มีหัวหน้าลูกน้อง เพราะทุกคนคือ ""ทีม""
พวกเราสนใจเทคโนโลยีใหม่ๆ อยู่เสมอไม่ว่าจะเป็นเรื่อง Software และ Hardware
พวกเรารักในการเขียนโปรแกรม และ Agile Development
ไม่มีข้อจำกัดเรื่องการแต่งตัว จะใส่ขาสั้น ส้นตึก เสื้อยืด รองเท้าแตะก็ตามสะดวก (กล้าใส่มาทำงานก็พอ)
งานเสร็จเมื่อไร งานเลี้ยงฉลองก็ตามมาทันที เพราะพวกเรารักการเลี้ยงฉลองกันเป็นอย่างมาก และพร้อมจะสนุกกันเต็มที่
กระหายในการเรียนรู้และชอบการพัฒนาตัวเองตลอดเวลา
พวกเรามักพูดถึงเรื่องแรงบันดาลใจ และ ข่าวที่น่าสนใจบ่อยๆ
พวกเรารู้ดีกว่าการทำงานภายใต้แรงกดดันมากๆ เป็นยังไง ดังนั้นงานของพวกเราก็จะมีความกดดันน้อย มีเวลาให้มากพอสำหรับแต่ละงาน มากพอที่จะมีเวลากิน มีเวลาเล่น และมีเวลาเต้น
ถึงจะดูชิวๆและผ่อนคลายเกินไปหน่อย แต่ก็มีความรับผิดชอบ และเสร็จงานตรงเวลา
